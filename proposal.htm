<h1>Project Proposal</h1>
<hr>

<h2>What is your website about? </h2>
<p>My website is about New York food guide. This is a website that helps hungry foodies to navigate to restaurants they like. There will be recommendations to foodies with different cuisines and price ranges. </p>


<h2> What is your objective of your website?</h2>
<p>This objective of my website that navigates foodies in New York to find top rating restaurants. I want to create a website similar to yelp, but a website that recommends people with high ratings restaurants only. </p>

<h2> Who is your target audience?</h2>
<p>My target customers are people who live in New York or visitors from other places. Anyone who is in New York can benefit from this website.</p>

<h2> What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h2>
<p>In my first page, I want to grab people's attention by making it pretty since it is homepage. There will be four links that people can click on. The first one is "Asian Cuisine" and introduce best restaurants in different price ranges. The other 3 links contains the same contents, but the other three cuisine categories will be Italian, Mediterranean, and Mexican.</p>
